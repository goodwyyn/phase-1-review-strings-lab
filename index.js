const myString = 'template literal';

const myNumber = 10 ;

const myBoolean = false;

`saying that the interpolation with ${myString}s is better then concantenation ${90 + myNumber}% of the time is simply ${myBoolean}. But it is pretty cool!
Beware that the new lines inside of a ${myString} will be preserved as new line in the resulting ${typeof myString}!`;
